Code Repository for sample code I have done

Advanced Algorithms: 
  Two problems I solved during a test for my Advanced Algorithms course, showing proficiency in Python.

Machine Learning:
  A Classification problem using a combination of Decision Trees, KNN, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, ultimately combined using an Ensemble.

Deep Learning:
  A Sentence classifier performing sentiment analysis on Customer Support dataset scraped from several locations on the internet. Transformers, accessed through the Pytorch wrapper Flair, were ultimately the most successful. Data was upsampled through NLPaug.
