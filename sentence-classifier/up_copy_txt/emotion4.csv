4,Yesterday I was in the economy class of Turkish Airlines on my way back home but still had one of the best meals I've ever had on board (aand it was free!)
4,massive thank you to and for getting this resolved for me in a timely manner they handled my grumpiness well
4,it makes me sick dawg chipotle wild trash the disrespect is real brodie
4,Scolding me for an unsuitable solution when you haven't specified your full requirements isn't helpful.
4,"However, the real disaster was actually the coming back trip!!"
4,i hate your website tried multiple times in a booking and it will not continue to payment and hangs tried on all different browsers no choice but to book thru travel agent but exec line treats travel agency booking like pariah why
4,They offered NO direction or help other than asking people to leave the carge office.
4,need to fix whatever tf is going on w my phone i cant even listen to my music i pay for it i better be able to listen to it
4,since amazon cancelled my uk membership i am stuck with chetan bhagat in the literature section do you even know what literature is fuck
4,"Are my expectations unreasonable (do not overcharge for services, replay to complaint emails)????"
4,"And I, on the other hand, am extremely confused and frustrated that I can't speak to Aeromexico directly (or email them, for that matter)."
4,that is not true at all the regular price for 2 yrs is rs 89376 and the discounted price is rs 89376 if the promotional code was genuinely valid there would have been a 25 drop as claimed in the final discounted price so far running a fake sale i recvd an email offering 25 off on my next new purchase so i went over to bcoz i wanted a new domain and it seems that you are not offering a 25 discount at all cheap pr stunt i must say you will lose customers i tell you that one
4,The complete inability of anyone representing AA at the airport or on the phone to address the situation was beyond irresponsible.
4,Their security staff is rude and there is no concept of organized boarding at Heathrow.
4,i am having so much trouble with my apple id accepting my payment details i cannot download or update anything i am about to go to android this is horrible nothing is working for me
4,why should we be loyal to your airline yet again for an international flight youve placed me in a middle seat diamondmeansnothing
4,What's the next move (besides obviously never flying with them again and advising everyone I know to do the same)?
4,One concierge even hugged me when we left and said she was going to miss me!
4,I just had the worst experience booking flights to Mexico with Interjet.
4,after 4 recaptcha i finally got to paywhat a bad user experience i got herenearly did not want to buy anymore
4,We lost a whole day in Rome b/c Delta has no clue how to properly service their planes.
4,"Only to be told that they don't give insurance or cancellation advice on this number,you need to do it online!!!"
4,you have failed to install my internet for 2 days several phone calls in and i cant even get a manager incompetent wastedmyweekend
4,this new email change sucks hate it go back to old notfunctional
4,These were families with children waiting and this was an absurd way to handle the situation.
4,absolute joke after waiting all day for an order placed on friday on prime
4,I have been basically been robbed and this could have turned out alot worse than it did had i missed my connecting flight.
4,massively disappointed with two of your restaurants tonight
4,i hate you how hard is it to not put onions in my taco
4,"If they can not responsibly transport a dog, YOU are not safe on this Airline."
4,will there be an update coming soon thats gonna fix my battery issues or should i just throw away the whole phone and use a pigeon
4,"When I buy a game, I make an agreement between me and the producer - not a middleman!BAD MOVE Activision."
4,"The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value."
4,"After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us."
4,What is most frustrating is that there is no way to find a flight with two upgrade-able seats without calling AA -- and waiting through three minutes of canned drivel before we find a representative and go through the whole 'wanna' list with her.
4,I am flying Virgin Australia to Los Angeles and absolutely hate plane food (always have horrible stomach pains after eating it) Wanting to bring my own food on the plane but concerned with customs etc with what I can bring instead of paying large amounts of money for food beyond customs which is equally horrible.
4,The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers.
4,I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company).
4,I should have known better than to book a low-cost flight through an agency...or at least through That agency!
4,"I tried to call the airline but nobody picked up, now I'm waiting for the reply email which I don't know whether they will even cared to read."
4,We were pleased with our flights and now look forward to our trip on the Dreamliner this summer.
4,"And, its been reappropriated by the pretty people as a fantastic facial wrinkle cream."
4,"As a current PT student, I have an *amazing* network of rising stars at a number of bay area companies, right now."
4,I was only wondering:And something entirely different:Thanks you guys!
4,However our system says I can make you a new Promo code now!
4,They quickly checked us in and to our surprise we were all seated together 9ABCDE.
4,my mom always asks me if i want mcdonalds and i think that is rlly beautiful
4,"Voila -- no checked baggage, no carry-on baggage, no problems (and wear flip-flops on your feet)."
4,this is how ups delivered my package out 800 of christmas money for my 5 children angry mommy
4,help me rt ok the boxes irritating i updated my phone what else do you want from me
4,Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service.
4,Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 1/2 hours.
4,I certainly paid enough for the ticket and don't see any reason to give more money for something that never cost money until now.
4,What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question.
4,"In a way, this may be Bush's genius, that he understands what lies Americans are willing to accept, and not accept."
4,i had already sent the details in message dm amp spoke to customer services but no body tells why do you need extra information from me even every detail is same you reverify every account annually what is your criteria to do so
4,They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline.
4,We were originally looking at booking thru flight centre but they want to charge us $20 extra per person per flight on top of flight price to get a ticket I just feel ripped off so I'm looking at booking direct myself.
4,i know my internet speed technically says up to 25mb but all i am getting is 8mb that is not even half not acceptable
4,9 days and counting tho appreciate people are busy and have workloads to get through but 9 days without a response that is quite a lot is not it
4,"I fly this route annually/bi-annually to visit in-laws with my children and husband who were on this flight with me, they're all fine (kids were 16 months and 3), I'm still a mess, can't watch safety video and have to take valium."
4,"I called Delta, who said there was nothing they could do - if the travel agent won't change it, I'm SOL."
4,\n\nAn alternative explanation is the easy one:  there is no G-d.
4,Also they did send me an email with an offer of a voucher to be redeemed on a future Thomas cook holiday (expires in 12 months) but as I am unable to do that I have asked them to send me a cheque which you are legally entitled to do.
4,I am totally confused with the regulations at this stage!
4,She was sitting next to me and said that she would have been fired on the spot for such a landing!
4,can you please stop making me update my xbox every couple of days i dont get many days off and i want to be able to play
4,how the heck is that possible it is a card issued by yall
4,"The moral of the story use yoru mastercard as I did and dispute the transaction on return then they wil actually listen as the Booking was made from the UK our rules apply regardless of the lack of clarity on the Airasia site so I will update the outcome, for me its not about the Â£20 its more about the priciple now so fight on ;)"
4,"The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day)."
4,can you please tell me why my 7 almost burned a hole in my pants and why my flashlight or camera doesnt work now
4,it is every show even the damn commercials i get 1 minutes then bam error
4,And this was how I was repayed What a lousy customer loyalty reward.
4,hey the whole idea of dvr is so you dont have to watch commercialswhat am i paying for
4,really because i used to have 3gb which i never ran out of then all of a sudden id use up all my data in a month without actually doing anything had to upgrade to 15gb and now i apparently use 80 of that cant wait to switch to 3 roll on end of contract
4,i ordered several hundred dollars worth of clothes and shoes for a trip i have in a couple days you delivered it to the completely wrong state sc this needs to be fixed as soon as possible asap and delivered to my address in florida nothappy
4,It kind of defeats the purpose of going to the airport the day before if we are going to have to stand and queue in the same queue that we would have stood in had we just taken our cases in the morning!
4,so i used for the 1st and last time food was more than 1 hour later than promised and was cold nothappy

4,I like my cast iron and Le Creuset ovens a WHOLE lot better for every conceivable purpose.
4,I would like to speak to your manager because this is not acceptable.

4,your new update makes it impossible for me to even open my phone look at the time or do anything
4,"Another Crosman piece of junk took it out of the box, and it is rattling."
4,There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration.
4,Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction.

4,"Looking over my flights, I'm not really feeling confident and just wanted to check if I should go ahead with this flight, or if I should be contacting American to see about a change?"
4,"I like gentoo/portage... I think there should be a project that will allow portage to create deb packages, since portage is an awesome tool for compile-time configuration"
4,"I know times are hard, but why do these companies insult our intelligence by claiming that the latest penny-pinching reduction in service is an improvement?"

4,why should we be loyal to your airline yet again for an international flight youve placed me in a middle seat diamondmeansnothing

4,"After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us."
4,What is most frustrating is that there is no way to find a flight with two upgrade-able seats without calling AA -- and waiting through three minutes of canned drivel before we find a representative and go through the whole 'wanna' list with her.
4,I am flying Virgin Australia to Los Angeles and absolutely hate plane food (always have horrible stomach pains after eating it) Wanting to bring my own food on the plane but concerned with customs etc with what I can bring instead of paying large amounts of money for food beyond customs which is equally horrible.
4,The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers.
4,I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company).
4,I should have known better than to book a low-cost flight through an agency...or at least through That agency!

4,Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service.
4,Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 1/2 hours.
4,I certainly paid enough for the ticket and don't see any reason to give more money for something that never cost money until now.
4,What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question.
4,"In a way, this may be Bush's genius, that he understands what lies Americans are willing to accept, and not accept."
4,i had already sent the details in message dm amp spoke to customer services but no body tells why do you need extra information from me even every detail is same you reverify every account annually what is your criteria to do so
4,They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline.
4,We were originally looking at booking thru flight centre but they want to charge us $20 extra per person per flight on top of flight price to get a ticket I just feel ripped off so I'm looking at booking direct myself.
4,i know my internet speed technically says up to 25mb but all i am getting is 8mb that is not even half not acceptable
4,9 days and counting tho appreciate people are busy and have workloads to get through but 9 days without a response that is quite a lot is not it
4,"I fly this route annually/bi-annually to visit in-laws with my children and husband who were on this flight with me, they're all fine (kids were 16 months and 3), I'm still a mess, can't watch safety video and have to take valium."
4,"I called Delta, who said there was nothing they could do - if the travel agent won't change it, I'm SOL."
4,\n\nAn alternative explanation is the easy one:  there is no G-d.
4,Also they did send me an email with an offer of a voucher to be redeemed on a future Thomas cook holiday (expires in 12 months) but as I am unable to do that I have asked them to send me a cheque which you are legally entitled to do.
