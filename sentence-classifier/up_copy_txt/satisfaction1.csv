1,this is really the worst thing with amazon shame is this the way to deal with costumers day one only i raised this issue through mail infact no one told during my interaction with executives initially
1,The last time someone told me that they lied and I was on hold for at least a half hour.
1,"Had An eight night holiday which I cannot get to ,not to mention my return was also booked HIR - NAN - HNL Also on FIJI airways ... What a bunch of crooks"
1,"The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value."
1,"After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us."
1,What is most frustrating is that there is no way to find a flight with two upgrade-able seats without calling AA -- and waiting through three minutes of canned drivel before we find a representative and go through the whole 'wanna' list with her.
1,I am flying Virgin Australia to Los Angeles and absolutely hate plane food (always have horrible stomach pains after eating it) Wanting to bring my own food on the plane but concerned with customs etc with what I can bring instead of paying large amounts of money for food beyond customs which is equally horrible.
1,The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers.
1,I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company).
1,"Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs, I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me."
1,I should have known better than to book a low-cost flight through an agency...or at least through That agency!
1,Have other passengers had the bad luck of dealing with rude and unhelpful Qatar Airways staff?
1,"These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines."

1,Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service.
1,no point know now service is cancalled now having to spend for alternative travel does not help my wallet seriously dang right disgusted that this happens every day seriously need to stop up your game here
1,Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 1/2 hours.
1,I certainly paid enough for the ticket and don't see any reason to give more money for something that never cost money until now.
1,I also went on a few travel review sites seems that I am one of many people who have had a bad experience with this airline.
1,What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question.
1,They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline.
1,the question is not about applying visa so disappointed on your online support
1,one of your jfk representatives however managed to cancel my entire return trip from ppt to jfk over the thanksgiving wknd and i almost ended up in nz i need to speak to somebody in charge about all this fiasco email
1,We were originally looking at booking thru flight centre but they want to charge us $20 extra per person per flight on top of flight price to get a ticket I just feel ripped off so I'm looking at booking direct myself.

1,"I fly this route annually/bi-annually to visit in-laws with my children and husband who were on this flight with me, they're all fine (kids were 16 months and 3), I'm still a mess, can't watch safety video and have to take valium."
1,Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo).
1,"Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers."
1,"I called Delta, who said there was nothing they could do - if the travel agent won't change it, I'm SOL."

1,"From reading a lot of information online it seems that because I am travelling on two budget airlines I have to clear immigration, then wait on the ""outside"" of the airport until the counter for my flight open... likely 3 hours before my flight at 9pm."
1,can you tell me why the pumpkin my flat bought from you yesterday put maggots all over our kitchen table
1,"The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day)."
1,Flights out were fine but the flight back was not as our airplane was changed to a three three three configuration so our seats which were still 3A and 3B were so small in width we could only just sit in them and when our meal was brought round we could not put the tables down to eat our meals as the tables were in the armrests hence the reason the seats were not very wide.
1,"The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie."
1,"can i get anything back, or is it hopeless....i take it the trash can uses the rm command or hopefully some other method????"

1,that does not justify the difference in price you are suggesting that because other places charge more you can charge more because asda is close to cheaper station you u lower ur price to compete but because the other store is a few miles away you u can keep price highr
1,i ordered several hundred dollars worth of clothes and shoes for a trip i have in a couple days you delivered it to the completely wrong state sc this needs to be fixed as soon as possible asap and delivered to my address in florida nothappy
1,It kind of defeats the purpose of going to the airport the day before if we are going to have to stand and queue in the same queue that we would have stood in had we just taken our cases in the morning!
1,so i used for the 1st and last time food was more than 1 hour later than promised and was cold nothappy

1,His 3.3 yards per carry are actually worse than last year!
1,When I checked in at Melbourne Airport I had the misfortune to be quite ill with flu and on top of not feeling well I had problems with my ticket.
1,"Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back."

1,not happy with uber driver called to cancel on me and tells me no charge see 1000 dollar charge for canceling not cool not responding

1,i have been billed again for 2 orders when i only placed one i have emailed this through i want a refund for the amount taken asap wtf
1,you u cannot hide illegal work on the name of terms and conditionsdis is my money amp will use according our choice
1,There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration.
1,"The crying and screaming of so many babies setting each other off led to those paying passengers around them getting less service from the staff, while they concentrated their attention on the young children."
1,Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction.
1,3 flights in a roll yesterday were grounded for hours in San Diego with made up mechanical problems It was a nightmare for my family.
1,I was forced to book another flight which left in two hours and cost alot more than the original.

1,will there be an update coming soon thats gonna fix my battery issues or should i just throw away the whole phone and use a pigeon
1,this is really the worst thing with amazon shame is this the way to deal with costumers day one only i raised this issue through mail infact no one told during my interaction with executives initially
1,The last time someone told me that they lied and I was on hold for at least a half hour.
1,"Had An eight night holiday which I cannot get to ,not to mention my return was also booked HIR - NAN - HNL Also on FIJI airways ... What a bunch of crooks"
1,"The employees are incompetenent, don't care and the airline is incapable of being trusted to transport an animal, child or anything of value."
1,"After speaking with an extremely unhelpful and rude supervisor, and explaining our situation, she said she would investigate further and disappeared, only to return 45 minutes later to again repeat there were no seats for us."
1,What is most frustrating is that there is no way to find a flight with two upgrade-able seats without calling AA -- and waiting through three minutes of canned drivel before we find a representative and go through the whole 'wanna' list with her.
1,I am flying Virgin Australia to Los Angeles and absolutely hate plane food (always have horrible stomach pains after eating it) Wanting to bring my own food on the plane but concerned with customs etc with what I can bring instead of paying large amounts of money for food beyond customs which is equally horrible.
1,The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers.
1,I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company).
1,"Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs, I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me."
1,I should have known better than to book a low-cost flight through an agency...or at least through That agency!
1,Have other passengers had the bad luck of dealing with rude and unhelpful Qatar Airways staff?
1,"These puppies and family pets were left unattended in small crates for an unhealthy amount of time, neglected by American Airlines."
1,It took ages for them to pick up the phone and they kept quoting the new price but as soon as I agreed then they would pass me on to another person or cut the phone.
1,think well have enjoyed the chicken by the time we make our next visit thank you though x refusing to give a free plastic bag with a roast chicken as its wrapped so it doesnt leak meat residue in bag not good
1,very disappointed i was disconnected with no solution
1,this is how ups delivered my package out 800 of christmas money for my 5 children angry mommy
1,help me rt ok the boxes irritating i updated my phone what else do you want from me
1,not true unfortunately most passengers are still on the train and i am still standing its rammed front to back is that enough feedback for you
1,Every flight on AA that we've taken since the merger we could hear the flight attendants complaining and they could care less about the service.
1,no point know now service is cancalled now having to spend for alternative travel does not help my wallet seriously dang right disgusted that this happens every day seriously need to stop up your game here
1,Instead of being helpful and sympathetic the Australian staff working behind the counters sent me away 4 times to different counters to try and sort out my problem which took over an 1 1/2 hours.
1,I certainly paid enough for the ticket and don't see any reason to give more money for something that never cost money until now.
1,I also went on a few travel review sites seems that I am one of many people who have had a bad experience with this airline.
1,What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question.
1,They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline.
1,the question is not about applying visa so disappointed on your online support
1,one of your jfk representatives however managed to cancel my entire return trip from ppt to jfk over the thanksgiving wknd and i almost ended up in nz i need to speak to somebody in charge about all this fiasco email
1,We were originally looking at booking thru flight centre but they want to charge us $20 extra per person per flight on top of flight price to get a ticket I just feel ripped off so I'm looking at booking direct myself.
1,you just tweeted this same thing at me the other day thats what im sayingi start work at 7am why cant i have a big mac
1,i hope package is delivered todayif m not available then tell courier boy to wait sometime and do call mealready disapointed
1,email i have been having billing problems with uber ever since i changed from cash to card before my issue was resolved without any hassles however i am still waiting for a resolution for a double billing that occurred on the 19th of november i have sent numerous emails
1,i know my internet speed technically says up to 25mb but all i am getting is 8mb that is not even half not acceptable
1,9 days and counting tho appreciate people are busy and have workloads to get through but 9 days without a response that is quite a lot is not it
1,"I fly this route annually/bi-annually to visit in-laws with my children and husband who were on this flight with me, they're all fine (kids were 16 months and 3), I'm still a mess, can't watch safety video and have to take valium."
1,Furthermore we have a lot of stress (nobody grants us that it would be possible to come back to sao paulo).
1,"Now, 3 months further, I still have no answer or payment by TAP or Ebookers."
1,"I called Delta, who said there was nothing they could do - if the travel agent won't change it, I'm SOL."
1,I am totally confused with the regulations at this stage!
1,can you please stop making me update my xbox every couple of days i dont get many days off and i want to be able to play
1,"huge overbook and again asking for volunteers, at least no aircraft downgrade."
1,how the heck is that possible it is a card issued by yall
1,"From reading a lot of information online it seems that because I am travelling on two budget airlines I have to clear immigration, then wait on the ""outside"" of the airport until the counter for my flight open... likely 3 hours before my flight at 9pm."
1,can you tell me why the pumpkin my flat bought from you yesterday put maggots all over our kitchen table
1,"The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day)."
1,Flights out were fine but the flight back was not as our airplane was changed to a three three three configuration so our seats which were still 3A and 3B were so small in width we could only just sit in them and when our meal was brought round we could not put the tables down to eat our meals as the tables were in the armrests hence the reason the seats were not very wide.
1,"The flight leaves late due to late inbound craft -(which is a BS excuse really - - a more honest one would be the craft was late because its on an end to end schedule with very tight turnaround times, and we stuffed up somewhere earlier in the day) So I land an hour late and then have to wait for my bags - C'est la vie."
1,"can i get anything back, or is it hopeless....i take it the trash can uses the rm command or hopefully some other method????"
1,can you please tell me why my 7 almost burned a hole in my pants and why my flashlight or camera doesnt work now

1,that does not justify the difference in price you are suggesting that because other places charge more you can charge more because asda is close to cheaper station you u lower ur price to compete but because the other store is a few miles away you u can keep price highr
1,i ordered several hundred dollars worth of clothes and shoes for a trip i have in a couple days you delivered it to the completely wrong state sc this needs to be fixed as soon as possible asap and delivered to my address in florida nothappy
1,It kind of defeats the purpose of going to the airport the day before if we are going to have to stand and queue in the same queue that we would have stood in had we just taken our cases in the morning!
1,so i used for the 1st and last time food was more than 1 hour later than promised and was cold nothappy
1,ur refurbished macbook pro sucks battery percentage stays the same random vibrating sounds and i only had it for 2 months

1,"After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than ""we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558""."
1,"Just thought I would let you travelers know about it, very disappointed."
1,His 3.3 yards per carry are actually worse than last year!
1,When I checked in at Melbourne Airport I had the misfortune to be quite ill with flu and on top of not feeling well I had problems with my ticket.
1,"Well, I called back three weeks later to rebook it, and he said that I only had two days to rebook the flight, that time had passed, they were taking my money and they would not be giving it back."
1,So it looks like i am not able to access education paths at all no matter what i do i can't even get to the tab.
1,Well that is rather annoying i do not understand why i am paying for this account when I cannot use it.
1,"The first laser I received was not aimed straight, and it was so far off I could not adjust it in."
1,"Ok, now it's actually worse, I can't log on at all, not just having material lost or credit not showing up."
1,"My name is Gianina Odom, and I am enrolled in a basic-level course right now, but the audio is so bad that I can barely understand the instructor."
1,Good thing this item was cheap cause now it is useless to me.
1,I would like to speak to your manager because this is not acceptable.

1,techylots takes 2 days to respond i dont have 2 days i need to know status now what is going on trying to get ipads ordered from techylots where are they need to speak with someone today not 2 days from now
1,I believe this is extremely poor and misleading practice which eventually deter many customers.
1,not happy with uber driver called to cancel on me and tells me no charge see 1000 dollar charge for canceling not cool not responding
1,They have obviously stopped caring at all and should do us all a favor by declaring bancruptcy and get out of a business that has clearly passed them by.
1,It cost me 8 RM just to get through the pre recorded messages about the new terminal then the guy on the phone pretended he couldn't hear me and I yes disconnected.
1,I poured 128 fluid ounces of Tuscan Whole Milk into this and it leaked all over my fridge.A poor quality product!
1,"Another Crosman piece of junk took it out of the box, and it is rattling."
1,i have been billed again for 2 orders when i only placed one i have emailed this through i want a refund for the amount taken asap wtf
1,you u cannot hide illegal work on the name of terms and conditionsdis is my money amp will use according our choice
1,There were 11 families waiting and as this dragged on with absolutely no communication there was obviously frustration.
1,"The crying and screaming of so many babies setting each other off led to those paying passengers around them getting less service from the staff, while they concentrated their attention on the young children."
1,Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction.

1,I was forced to book another flight which left in two hours and cost alot more than the original.

1,I am flying Virgin Australia to Los Angeles and absolutely hate plane food (always have horrible stomach pains after eating it) Wanting to bring my own food on the plane but concerned with customs etc with what I can bring instead of paying large amounts of money for food beyond customs which is equally horrible.
1,The transit at Heathrow (a refueling and more passengers stop) was the most miserable experience in all our flying years....We would not recommend to anyone flying through Heathrow as transit passengers.
1,I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company).
1,"Once on board the plane I was put next to a small baby and on asking the cabin crew if I could be moved as I did not want to give the child my germs, I was rudely told that there was nothing they could do for me."

1,I also went on a few travel review sites seems that I am one of many people who have had a bad experience with this airline.
1,What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question.
1,They forced us to check our bags or pay several hundred dollars to carry them on even though we had less then when we went down and the bags were standard carry size for any other airline.
